      "message": "I honestly don\u0027t want to add so much complexity for a simple feature. Why can it not just be a link?\n\nWe add an additional dependency, additional code, additional complexity - all for something that we talked about is temporary because we do eventually want changelogs inside the app.\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common#ViewUrl\n\n```\nfun openWebPage(url: String) {\n    val webpage: Uri \u003d Uri.parse(url)\n    val intent \u003d Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, webpage)\n    if (intent.resolveActivity(packageManager) !\u003d null) {\n        startActivity(intent)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKeep it simple, please. Updater is the app where we only add what\u0027s absolutely required, and nothing more. Any other app and it\u0027s different - but this one is critical.",
